import UIKit


//: ## Q1: Optionals
class Words {
    var wordA : String!
    var wordB : String!
    
    init (wordA: String?, wordB: String?) {
        self.wordA = wordA
        self.wordB = wordB
    }

//: ### Are the values passed in to the **init** function and those set to the instance
//: ### variables the same type? If not, why?


//: They're not because the instance variables are of type string and the init variables are of type string optional.


//: ## Q2: Variable Types and Function Types
    class func arePalindromes(words: [String]) -> Bool? {
        let reversedWords = words.map() { String(reverse($0)) }
        var numElements = words.count
        
        for i in 0...numElements-1 {
            if words[i] != reversedWords[i] {
                return false
            }
        }
        return nil
    }
//: ### Why does the compiler dislike the **for loop**? Fix it.
//: ### What else is wrong with this function? You may have to refer to (but **not**
//: ### change) the code at the very bottom. Debug the function.


//: Doesn't return anything if all are palindromes.

    func isAnagram() -> Bool? {

        var lenA = count(self.wordA)

        if lenA != lenB {
            return false
        }
        
        var arrA = Array(self.wordA)
        var arrB = Array(self.wordB)
        
        for i in 0...lenA-1 {
            let letter = arrA[i]
            if let val = countLetters[letter] {
                countLetters[letter] = val + 1
            } else {
                countLetters[letter] = 1
            }
        }

            let letter = arrB[i]
            if let val = countLetters[letter] {
                countLetters[letter] = val - 1
            } else {
                return false
            }
        }
        
        for (letter, count) in countLetters {
            if count != 0 {
                return false
            }
        }
        
        return nil
    }
//: ### What is the problem with declaring **countLetters** as we do in **Line X**,
//: ### and then using it in **Line Y**? Fix it (by only changing **Line X**).
//: ### What else is wrong with this function? You may have to refer to (but **not**
//: ### change) the code at the very bottom. Debug the function.


//: countLetters becomes a class variable so every time you call isAnagram additional letters are added to the dictionary.
